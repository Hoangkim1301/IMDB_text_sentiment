Text: I could not believe how terrible and boring this Hollywood remake was It s so dreadful It easily lands a place in my top 10 worst films of 1998 About the only thing it had going for it was Bruce Willis who should stick to action films as a completely emotionless killer who d kill his own mother for the right price But I d rather listen to Robbie Coltraine talk American for a week than listen to Richard Gere s nauseating Irish accent again But this film is also implausible unconvincing uneven unexciting unimpressive and lands Sidney Poiter in a rubbish role to make a possible career comeback One for filmroll footie purposes entirely

Text: I rented Boogie Nights last week and I could tell you when I watched the film I had a blast If you think that when you watch the film you will get sicked by the porn I mean yes if your not a porn person who can t bother being by it than this isn t the film to see But the thing is the whole film isn t really about porn Well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through The actors played there roles perfect especially Mark Wahlberg John C Reilly and William H Macy The sex scenes of course are terrific but mainly focus on the character s hype in porn films until there struggles Excellent film one of the best Hedeen s Outlook 10 10 A

Text: First off this movie is not near complete my guess is that someone actually bothered to steal every other page of the script The movie contains bizarre time travels without notice inconsistent dialogs misplaced details all over the music isn t very bad at all other then misplaced tracks and besides the fact that the volume goes up and down between the different tracks The cutting room did a descent job actually and that says a lot Missplaced sound effects ruin the tension though Luke Perry does what he does best just looking worried and occasionally coughing up punchlines from hell I seriously rate this movie as the worst of 2007 and i ve seen a few bad ones Do not spend money on this one it s not so bad it s a laugh it s worse Ratings above 1 star should render a blacklist at IMDb because it s a damn lie

Text: I watched this mini in the early eighties Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it It is both factual and entertaining Everyone should see it to know what really happened I was so moved I purchased and read the book Pppenheimer Shatterer of Worlds And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight If you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance Mr Waterston can really provide an audience Enjoy the movies

Text: This movie was never intended as a big budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy It probably won t change your life but it is certainly charming and engaging Clifton Webb plays a curmudgeon that s certainly not new who has a TV However his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation So he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids as he and his wife have none of their own So he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately Remember he IS a curmudgeon and doesn t particularly like kids To make things worse one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy No matter how indifferently he acts towards the kid the child just wants to spend time with him The kid is cute and nearly steals the show all by himself What happens next and the twists and turns of the movie are something you ll just have to find out for yourself Understand that this is a light cute and yet not cloying movie you ll probably enjoy

Text: I usually much prefer French movies over American ones with explosions and car chases but this movie was very disappointing There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens This French couple has been living in Lisbon for years and they return to Paris for a friend s wedding They announce to another friend they are having dinner with that they are going to split Then nothing much happens they don t seem to know whether they want to separate or not I don t necessarily think that their hesitations make for a bad movie it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good but this could be treated in an interesting manner giving some flesh to their desires and their relationship but that does not happen One gets out of the theater unsure of why these two got together or want to split The only piece I enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk That was true to life

Text: Hitchcock would be proud of this movie Even when nothing happens it is suspenseful Director David Lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse Altogether surreal this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible I am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things I missed and which may help me understand it better It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together so you must be patient and pay attention Get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts And yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme the mood the character development and the filming techniques The dual roles of the main actress Naomi Watts showcase her enormous talent That is when I could get my eyes off of her co star What an acting pair Lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles the length timing of editing cuts jumping back and forth between scenes Combined with smart use of music and sounds it all helps to build suspense in our minds doubtless a major objective of the director Well he kept me on the edge of my seat even had me talking to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there You know the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies

Text: OK So it can be done We have here the perfect vampire movie Gothic beautiful With all the ingredients A realistic vampire A wonderful story Take note I am from Transylvania and I assure you this movie respects the vampire lore It s exactly like the tales I heard in my childhood For a transylvanian it is quite believable You must see it if you are interested by real vampires as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent Hollywood movies as far as I can guess the Hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus which is pretty hilarious for me Vampires are never good looking or attractive they can inspire only horror and repulsion The incubus called in my country The Night Flier is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them I strongly recommend this for any Gothic person out there See also the sequels they are all 4 very good And of course don t miss DArk shadows Something similar is Nosferatu In Venice with Klaus Kinski I recommend that one to

Text: The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney himself this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting this is I believe the only animated Disney film since the 1940 s which is NOT based on an earlier book or other work but is rather an original story As others have noted the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in Lady and the Tramp and the kidnapping journey home story in 101 Dalmatians But to overcome this flaw the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the Disney animated films of the previous 10 15 years Phil Harris from The Jungle Book voicing one of the main characters follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film with another here with Scatman Crothers The quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from Dalmatians with some nice nods to French Impressionism it appears and the villain here the butler is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well This is probably one of Disney s least memorable villains The main story goes back and forth between the cats and the butler s ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs with great voice work by Pat Buttram and George Goober Lindsey The various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen Tramp and Dalmatians The cats owner while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in Sleeping Beauty bears none of that character s nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous The real strength of the film is the voice work after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in The Jungle Book the tactic is continued strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book and Eva Gabor who would do a very similar character in the later film The Rescuers as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp All are excellent here particularly Harris and Gabor in the leads The character animation is as excellent as one would expect showing a variety of emotions well Smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes an escape from the path of a speeding train a near drowning by one of the children but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly Overall there s very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other Disney classics One minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of 60 s culture are depicted among the jazz performing cats in supposedly 1910 Paris one can t help but wonder why the story wasn t set solidly in the present other than the great deal Paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time It really would have made more sense that way The songs while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed are not particularly memorable Nonetheless the general energy applied here the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses Far from the greatness of classic 10 s such as Pinocchio or Aladdin and not quite up to the 9 s one might give to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians this is probably a rather marginal 8 of 10 perhaps a 7

Text: Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress But this movie was so horrible I couldn t help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that I was actually watching something so crappy Ha ha The audio editing is horrible They try too hard to come up with creative camera angles Because they re just weird and stupid The script sucked Acting was horrible storyline not very good Very unrealistic even for a movie But it is a 20 year old movie so I ll give it a bonus point for that And yeah the music was terrible But we all got to start somewhere And submitting these things is such a hassle 10 line minimum bother Well now I know why I couldn t find this movie in the movie store I had to purchase it offline to see it good thing it was only 58 cents even though shipping was 2 59 Oh well I don t recommend anyone wasting their time and money seeing this film

Text: What can I say about this film other than the narrative is one of the most exciting in film history and based on a true story Being old enough to remember the Berlin Wall when it was still used to contain a country this film gives you a dark insight into the grim incarceration of East Berliners and their desperate attempts to escape no matter what the cost The film follows the lives of two families who decide to escape using a hot air balloon manufactured by themselves Forever fearing arrest by the authorities under scrutiny by neighbours they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall A tense thrilling story of courage and determination which truly pays homage to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom

Text: This which was shown dubbed in Italian at a Rome cinema not as bad as it sounds after being presented at the Rome Film Festival is very much an art film and a festival film guaranteed to charm and delight such audiences for its distinctive style droll humor ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others appealing cheery music spot on performances overriding sweetness and humanity but doomed because of its oddity and lack of a compelling story line to leave average audiences wondering what they re watching it for and why anyone admires it how it even got made Andersson gives us almost a series of dry skits Running through them are various themes Money a guy at the next table Waldemar Nowak nicks the wallet of a rich bore talking on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy then goes and orders a set of posh suits made to order a deadbeat son calls his celebrated father away from an elaborate gathering to beg him for one more loan A shrink worries aloud about his depleted investments while his wife humps him in bed wearing only a shiny Viking helmet Depression an elementary teacher Jessica Nilsson breaks down in class because her husband has called her a harpy the rug salesman spouse P r Fredriksson collapses before clients because he s called her that Several men have depressing dreams But hey this is Sweden Isn t everybody depressed Love problems a fat bohemian couple is perpetually breaking up a girl groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist Micke Eric B ckman Wives slam doors when their husbands start to practice their instruments Music too is obviously a unifying theme Besides the dashing guitarist there s a tuba and a drum player who re in a Dixierland band and also play in marches and funerals Every scene has an added lilt from the music which niftily links one sequence with another A raging storm outside the window of many scenes violent rain people out in it thunder so loud it sounds like a battle raging across the land This also unifies the tone and gives the impression various scenes are happening on the same dauntingly tempestuous day Andersson is a master of visual composition and the static middle distance shot and the film has a foggy gray green look engineered by DP Gustav Danielsson that s perfect because it evokes the gloom of a Swedish winter but also twinkles with the subtle colors of the director s wit which ends every scene with a smile One almost never knew drabness could be so beautiful Or perhaps one did Alexcanr Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts Within scenes and in the film as a whole there s a kind of stillness that comes out of the visual style the pacing of scenes and the detached humanism of the overall outlook There s something about a fully mastered style that s calming reassuring Not everything works equally well One may feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes which read too much sometimes like the work of a Saturday Night Live writer in need of Prozac Since some scenes plainly move you or draw a laugh it s obvious that others fall a little flat But some scenes are real zingers and one obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream described and then visualized dreams being another important thread in which the girl groupie imagines herself in a wedding dress newly married to her fey guitarist ideal who plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gathers outside a big window The viewpoint switches to outside and the window slides slowly away as if the building the dream newlyweds look out of were a train moving out of a station to take them to their honeymoon It s a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect Eventually one may feel everything in You the Living Du Levande is a dream including the recurring scene where the barman is always striking a bronze bell and announcing last order time whereupon all the torpid customers rise from their tables and go up to get one more drink An Italian reviewer called this a small great film and that s right It limits itself in a dozen ways but there is greatness in it Roy Andersson is a little master like some medieval miniaturist of the inner comedies of Scandanavian gloom and this is a film unlike any other Shown this year as a Cannes Un Certain Regard selection this is also the Swedish entry for the 2007 Best Foreign Oscar Hard to say what Bergman would think but Andersson worked with him is famous for his elaborately produced TV commercials some of which one can see on YouTube Bergman called them the best commercials in the world It will be interesting to see if this director whose craft is as subtle as his viewpoint will start working in longer segments some time Meanwhile any good film buff really needs to get a look at this Schadenfreude isn t quite the right word That means delight in the misery of others Andersson is teaching us to delight in the misery of all of us

Text: I once saw a bit of this film and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars the result being that I agree Basically the film begins with Kermit the Frog Steve Whitmire telling all his Muppet chums that they have lost everything and he ends sitting depressed and possibly thinking about suicide on the bench Meanwhile in another world Heaven angel Daniel David Arquette who had already been in Muppets from Space visits the Boss Whoopi Goldberg another reason I wanted to see the film to show that Kermit really needs help In the flashbacks it shows Kermit Miss Piggy Eric Jacobson not the original and better Frank Oz Gonzo Dave Goelz Fozzie Bear also Jacobson Pepe the Prawn Bill Barretta and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the Christmas holiday and it all seems to be going well But the really mean Rachel Bitterman Joan Cusack is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down and Kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn t happen Of course Kermit fails the last time and Bitterman tells him that they are finished and she can officially take the theatre This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit s guardian angel to try and help him but Kermit is not in the mood and eventually ends up saying I wish I was never born Obviously you can recognise the spoof of It s a Wonderful Life with Kermit as the George Bailey and Cusack as the Mr Potter and in the end obviously Kermit realises how much he means to everyone and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker Goelz as Dr Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf Barretta as Dr Teeth Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef Jacobson as Animal and Yoda the only character who sounds similar to Oz s version William H Macy as Glenn Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage Carson Daly Molly Shannon Scrubs Zach Braff Sarah Chalke Neil Flynn John C McGinley and Judy Reyes Mel Brooks as Joe Snow Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog Statler Pops and Floyd Pepper and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle The most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of Moulin Rouge besides that and the well known faces in it not fantastic It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song Everyone Matters The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons Adequate

Text: Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life sliding increasingly into decay In her search for meaning she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents quickly spirals out of control Little Vera is shocking and disturbing in nearly every way The drinking of the father the enabling and lack of understanding of the mother the casual lies and misdirection of the brother and Vera herself forgiving them all their flaws are all shocking and slightly disturbing to watch However the raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters Set in cramped spaces and vast urban decay Little Vera presented a vastly different view of Soviet life than had ever been seen before In fact Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society painted in shades of pain desperation and rust It is the implosion of a family set against the implosion of an entire social order Although painful and desperately unsatisfying the film itself is definitely worth seeing if only to understand the feelings and cultures still reshaping Russia today

Text: Though this film doesn t stand out particularly from the movie crowd its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up There maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch and the cinematic are a little slipshod the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it The music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie The acting is none the less impressive especially the dog he he with John Travolta taking the lead of the fun troublesome loving Michael Other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the film So after a long day at work stick Michael on in the evening with some ice cream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right

Text: I love horror films but I think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind The Devil s Backbone The Exorcist for example This is that kind of film and it s not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be it is also really beautiful A Tale of Two Sisters starts really slow so if you re in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed Actually this is not a ghost story though there are some It s something more complex and it s done in such a way that it beats Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring no sweat A Tale is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless Every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you re the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie The acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl Those two are worth the price of the ticket alone Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film

Text: I can t quite explain why I find this so alluring and The Leopard not it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently Like that film it has a majestically slow pace but this time it isn t overlong It s the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini story Like The Leopard it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos though Bogard s performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable especially in look he has a really stupid grin that s easy to dislike It s often quite beautiful in the quiet moments It s the opulence of Visconti s films the grandeur of the ball scenes that I find tedious as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision But here that is part of the point Gustav surrounded by a visual din The way in which the object of Gustav s affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant the camera shows a girl girl girl then this beautiful feminine featured boy It s like an allusion to Shakespeare s sonnets and it doesn t feel heavy handed It s not until the camera views Tadzio fully pulls back and we see his long slender legs that we realize he is not a boy but an adolescent at first we re forced to question Gustav s attraction in an uncomfortable way Visconti must have known that and he doesn t shy away from it Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav we get a sense of the man we know him It s a largely silent performance and when he does open his mouth it s to spew venom no wonder he wants the angelic open featured boy to project himself onto There s a difference with Tadzio we never know him just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesques but that s because his life is another its own film but it s not as flirtatious as it s been made to seem there is one scene however where he twirls around a pole that s too much Tadzio isn t necessarily leading him on he s looking at him Visconti just zooms in is all The film doesn t detail Gustav as being gay Tadzio isn t even really male he s a prettified version of a boy delicate pale wispy with golden locks that everyone seems to love including one gorgeous slightly older young man who he wrestles with The closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to Gustav s homosexuality is the famous barber scene which unlocks his repressed vanity It isn t totally successful the whole section with Alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes people carrying bags in long shot could have been excised Some parts are heavy handed such as when Gustav s boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by the looks on his face are too obvious But during the same scene Gustav throws a fit wanting a new rower something so unexplainable that it makes up for it But there are some scenes touching for the first time that build up a remarkable quiet intensity Tadzio repeating a piano song again and again the notes quivering in the air may be the best example of the anxiety the film has There is one discussion that contains a debate I m especially interested Can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses or does it have to go beyond them We can consider Tarkovsky who esteems both Visconti and Mann to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations I think this one manages to do both 9 10

Text: This film is strictly for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher I get angry at TCM for showing this mess more frequently than Bachelor Mother the delightful original I get angrier still that some Hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake Bachelor Mother filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a cute comedy Instead Hollywood could have spent the time money energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original Wow what a concept Bachelor Mother the original with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew simmering with sexuality It is a 1930 s wink at the Hays Office Bundle of Joy the remake with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is strictly milk and cookies It is a 1950 s handshake with Eisenhower Which cast would you rather watch Debbie Reynolds Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou or Ginger Rogers David Niven and Charles Coburn For me every member of the cast in the original version is far better than his her counterpart in the remake In the original a beautiful young Ginger Rogers is at her peak David Niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate And I always love to see Charles Coburn in a movie In Bachelor Mother he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe In Bundle of Joy Debbie Reynolds is her usual perky self She is fine in this role although her performance along with Fisher s completely changes the tone of the story As an actor Eddie Fisher is hopeless He is completely lacking in screen presence Here he is way too wholesome for this story His acting is completely bland and clueless Likewise his singing is so bland and unremarkable that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large The only time he is not completely painful is in Butterfield 8 where incidentally he doesn t sing Here Fisher s lame performance alone is enough to ruin this movie Adolphe Menjou a favorite character actor delivers a competent performance but not one of his best He is more blustering than commanding He and Fisher are not convincing as a father and son Do you see a musical for the music the story being merely incidental Or do watch a musical for a story with some hopefullly good music used for seasoning If the former you might like this lame remake Otherwise you are much better off watching the Ginger Rogers non musical original Bachelor Mother

Text: You can generally ask two questions concerning 80 s low budget horror films and this Demon Wind in particular 1 Is it a good film No 2 Is it a fun film You bet Demon Wind is a gruesomely filthy and nauseating tale filled with cheesy make up effects and nasty violence The story is pretty much non existent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the groups ancestors Apparently his grandparents used to live in a devil worshiping neighborhood and evil in the form of demons and fog still dwells around there But I got to hand it to this film from start to finish it breathes morbidity The diabolical undertones the playful gore and the relatively decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream uninspired 80 s slashers for sure It shows some creativity and guts literally where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily This creators clearly got inspired by the success of the Evil Dead and perhaps even Lamberto Bava s Demons but what the heck It s fun and made with lots of enthusiasm Although this film does have a pretty high what the f standard at times Especially near the end when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed And what the hell is the story on those two wannabe magicians Nonetheless Demon Wind gets my recommendation if your likes aren t too high concerning crap horror

Text: Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was always attempting to push the envelope and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on his mind Strangers on a Train one of Hitchcock s first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over 50 years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique Arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 if perhaps slightly less shocking The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience s focus even in slower scenes If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion Sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film s most tense and engaging scene These are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clich e after clich e it s wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original Sure it s fairly straightforward but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of today s day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch the film s brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while One can t help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanity s heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder as well as Bruno s own cavalier attitude towards death Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour Bruno popping a child s balloon with his cigarette is priceless and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easy going environments such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere This may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable The antagonistic figure of Bruno essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker sadly in his last film role but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment Bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people Bruno could seem to represent the Id as Freud would put it the inner darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure Guy Haines and how bland and uninteresting he seems almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing Yet despite this implied message Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome It s a testament to actor Farley Granger s talent that despite Robert Walker s villain easily stealing the show Granger s hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character Superb support is given by Ruth Roman who manages to overcome the clich e and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guy s horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and Patricia Hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the director s daughter would imply The superb cast headed by a simply wonderful Walker really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock s breathtaking stylistics All in all Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but it s still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago Once again Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the film s surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience 9 10

Text: SPOILERS SPOILERS Some bunch of Afrikkaner Hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area Spoilers The dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick and cracks it open Then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and SURPRISE something eats him The other two dimwits are not seen alive again Scott Bairstow looks like a Pizza Delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree which means he should be about 35 years old minimum Bairstow is supposed to join Camp C and help them find diamonds The truck that picks up Bairstow to take him to Camp C has a handful of the kind of weirdoes that usually populate movies like PITCH BLACK THE THING etc The truck happens to drive across the first truck and they decide to investigate how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up Bairstow since they were travelling the same road So they find the eaten bodies and there are some decent special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them The main lunatic in the group Karl decides that they must find the killer So the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks and eventually it has an electrical short and the crew is stuck in the desert The dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around When he takes a nap wearing the same jacket the creatures eat him alive and another guy runs over and sticks his arm into the goo and that dummy loses his arm too Sounds exciting so far except that a few minutes later Dr Bairstow realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive because the miners cracked open the old hive Now last time I checked ants could move around on their own without having to kill people in order to use the bones for structure If all they need was something hard they could have put a bunch of sticks together and used those to create a form The whole story is really really dumb and the ant explanation is the only one given The rest of the movie is just about the group getting killed off until they find the new ant nest and kill the ant brain sort of and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own itty bitty feet There is a spare ant brain found off camera and sent back for analysis thus creating a reason for a sequel

Text: The film Chaos takes its name from Gleick s 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory What does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie Chaos Nothing The film makers seem to have skimmed the book obviously without understanding a thing about it looking for a theme to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film In this respect the movie Choas resembles the Canadian effort Cube in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed in Cube a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes the same approach is taken in Chaos disconnected extracts from Gleick s books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever This of course is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience and any literate viewer of Chaos who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered How could a film so bad be made Rewritten as a novel the story in Chaos would probably not even make it past a literary agent s secretary s desk How could at least hundreds of thousands and probably millions of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film Regarding what s in the movie every performance is phoned in Save for technical glitches it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene The story is uniformly senseless the last time I saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eight year old Among other massive shortcomings are the following The bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow He has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints Police officers do not carry or use radios Dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy Let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film If there is any other movie you like or even simply do not hate watch that instead

Text: Peter O Toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie I have seen the original version with Robert Donat and I much prefer Peter O Toole s performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical I ve really never seen anything that Mr O Toole is in that I don t like He is a brilliant actor multi talented giving performances full of passion and depth Petula Clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part It is an all around heartwarming movie full of tenderness and bittersweet fun I will always remember in para phrase the line where Mr Chips regrets he has never given her children and she replies Of course you have hundreds of them all boys Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion

Text: King Vladislav Angus Scrimm of Romania is a vampire but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with mankind But his son Radu Anders Hove is a cruel creature to his very heart which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him Three female students have come to study local folklore but find themselves drawn into the vampires legends at just the wrong time Vladislav has been killed Who can say anything bad about a film featuring a cameo from Angus Scrimm I can t I mean I had some low expectations after seeing other Full Moon pictures Puppet Master in particular and Demonic Toys But despite the really bad animated effects of the demons this film was actually really well done and very fun to watch Plenty of blood a good plot and backstory the Bloodstone story was surprisingly refreshing and even some new angles on the vampire mythos which you d think would be dead by now Maybe I m wrong but this is probably the first film to feature rosary beads being fired from a gun Aside from vampires and blood you get a share of nudity gratuitous but welcome and I had to notice the excellent score from the composers not sure who deserves credit but those involved include Stuart Brotman Richard Kosinski William Levine Michael Portis and John Zeretzka This is Horror 101 all the way Heck you even get two sequels which is the sign of a true horror film Of course some bad films get sequels too did I mention Puppet Master The Romanian theme was well done and the film even seems to have been made by Romanians if I am guessing their name origins correctly And the score the music really stood out for me as a nice change of pace very mood setting I like Richard Band but I m glad another composer was given a shot because he nailed the atmosphere on the head If you like vampire films and want a slight variation one of the Eastern European variety this is worth seeing

Text: This Is Not a Film works because it is so true in what it is trying to say If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus in on the message you will see a little bit of yourself in the main character Michael Whether male or female all of us have come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and reexamine a situation or a relationship Did it really occur like we remembered What went wrong Michael s desire to find Grace is completely selfish More than anything he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out But even so he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships We would not be in them otherwise As the film ends I am not sure if Michael has learned anything new about himself or not Our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend Nadia She is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to every story I found Michael to be pompous arrogant and just plain clueless Which is exactly why I liked him He is a real character If you ve ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship then this is a film for you In closing it is a film for everyone

Text: I saw this film when it first came out and hated it I just saw it again 27 years later I actually liked some of it although Robin Williams was totally wrong for the role What I remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what I had understood when I read the book Since I haven t re read it I can only give you my impressions from the past but I am sure of one thing the film is a paean to family life whereas in the book almost ALL traditional institutions including and perhaps especially marriage are shown to be strait jackets that we would be well rid of The only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air Too bad Williams doesn t have a tenth of his charm My low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book As a film on its own it fares better but only for a few key performances Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful I think anyone watching it would fall in love with her And John Lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex change operation is fantastic he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity I watched him closely during all of his scenes and never once was he anything except womanly Nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen and that made all the difference In fact of all the people in the film his is the only one which is irreproachable It is worth seeing this film only for his performance

Text: Brown returned to his role from the year before in Slaughter for this rough follow up film In the original he had avenged his parents slaying by wiping out a huge mob organization in Mexico Here he is the one being pursued retaliated against by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon When the first assassination attempt fails Brown is back in action once more kicking gangster butt all over the place while trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry While the original film was overall a better and more coherent movie this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in far heavier doses making it more pleasing to fans of the genre Aside from a fairly dreary opening on horseback and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night this movie clips along at a very brisk pace Every few minutes there appears one or more of the following drug use sex nudity gunplay murder or some other action Brown is his usual reliable amiable self helped by his amazing physical presence which goes a long way in glossing over any stiffness in his acting McMahon is a riot With tinted glasses and his hair parted down the middle he is shown meting out orders to his gang of thugs and is overheard making passionate love to his fur clad bimbo Seeing Johnny Carson s sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill Stroud makes an impression as an intense racially bigoted hit man while Peters adds just a tinge of class as an upright police detective who enlists Brown s aid Sadly no mention at all is made of Brown s original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens Suddenly Brown now has a girlfriend Hendry who is likable enough but lacking in the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before Williams does an outrageous turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem The cinematography and overall direction is less polished than the first film but this one does have a drive and a sense of danger that exceeds the original s feel The film spends a lot of time in the sewage of organized crime drugs prostitution and other vices but it retains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the now startling lack of political correctness One odd note A key supporting player in the first film was shown getting shot to death but pops up here in a different role

Text: I watched this movie and all I can say is this I am not a film student nor am I some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that I don t understand However IF I were to do that with this film my thoughts would be Yep He s on drugs and I can picture it now he was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like hey wouldn t it be funny if nuns really could fly Like what if one just fell out of a plane and free fell for a while bounced to the ground and got up and walked away cackles or if buckwheat gave the pope a bath oh my god I m cracking up just thinking about it Dude We gotta make a movie about it And then he says to his friend as he s laughing Oh and wouldn t it be hilarious if people loved it and called me a genius for it So to me this is what happens when some guy does one too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie Should I have been doing LSD to understand what this guy was thinking so I could have had a laugh too Because I have to tell you I wasn t laughing I was yawning and checking the time I think everyone who is trying their hardest to find a deeper meaning is hysterical I had never heard of this director until I came to read the reviews which I did because I was mad that I lost that last 2 hrs or how ever long it was it felt like 12 hrs of my life and I can t ever get it back anyway I have read that this guy is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art what the heck is that So my point is sort of proved This guy is not all there he s a drug addict and his movie is evidence of such So please quit trying to find a deeper meaning to it If one really wants to understand everything in this movie go drop some LSD and sit back and relax then it might actually make sense It reminded me of the time I watched Gus Van Sant s Last Days another movie I was mad about watching I cannot help but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie if the same people reviewed it who reviewed this one It seems like if the movie s director is totally off his rocker or if it s a french movie with sex and subtitles or if it s a cartoon it is going to get great reviews hands down anything else is boring and has already been done BLAH bring on the boring please

Text: I m not the type of person to watch T V shows because the acting normally sucks or it s unrealistic or TOO dramatic But this show is perfect Everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys boyfriends always come second in her book She s a loyal friend and always the peace maker There s subtle romance which is what I like personally Not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives but a realistic type of romance Every character eventually gets it and they don t find their prince charming at first glance and they don t just fall in love with every guy that comes their way It s a realistic show but when you watch it you better brush up on your movies pop culture and random facts because Lorelai Gilmore is always making references I fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance so will you

Text: This is an amazingly well filmed early talkie adaptation of the Eugene O Neill play Its major drawback is a static camera and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is which is a pity for it s a good piece of primitive moviemaking made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker s intention Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films and her entrance is still classic Her voice is strangely deep almost boyish which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona As her boyfriend Charles Bickford is appropriately virile he was apparently born craggy and a perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo His Irish brogue is not bad at all and he seems always a natural man of the sea very O Neill like in his independent brooding nature As Garbo s very confused father George Marion seems truly from another time He has the sort of face and voice open unmannered totally without guile that has vanished from the earth Marie Dressler is also in the O Neill swing of things Her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis Poetic license perhaps as this is not in the script but we can forgive Miss Dressler s excesses she is too good at it not to The story ends with a movement to the next thing as distinct from resolution which isn t the author s cup of tea and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise In Anna Christie we are in O Neill country a place of sea storms and fog a feeling of all pervading and damnable uncertainty which we would now call ambivilance or anxiety neurosis Rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it as weather land ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard
